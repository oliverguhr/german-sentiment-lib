# German Sentiment Classification with Bert

This package provides a very simple interface to [detect the sentiment](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_Detection) of German texts. It uses the Googles Bert architecture trained on 1.834 million samples. The training data contains texts from various domains like Twitter, Facebook and movie, app and hotel reviews. You can find more information about the dataset and the training process in the [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.202.pdf).

## Install 

To get started install the package from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/germansentiment/):

```bash
pip install germansentiment
```

## Usage

```python
from germansentiment import SentimentModel

model = SentimentModel()

texts = [
    "Mit keinem guten Ergebniss","Das ist gar nicht mal so gut",
    "Total awesome!","nicht so schlecht wie erwartet",
    "Der Test verlief positiv.","Sie fährt ein grünes Auto."]
       
result = model.predict_sentiment(texts)
print(result)
```

The code above will output following list:

```python
["negative","negative","positive","positive","neutral", "neutral"]
```

## Results

If you are interested in code and data that was used to train this model please have a look at [this repository](https://github.com/oliverguhr/german-sentiment) and our [paper](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.201.pdf). Here is a table of the F1 scores that his model achieves on following datasets. Since we trained this model on a newer version of the transformer library, the results are slightly better than reported in the paper.
